    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Please carefully read the following description of the card game *Blackjack*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of Blackjack is to draw cards such that their values sum to as close to 21 as possible, but do not exceed 21. All cards 2 through 10 are assigned their number as the respective value, face cards like Jack, Queen and King yield a value of 10 points. The aces are special; they can count as either 1 or 11, depending on what is more beneficial. When using the ace as 11 points does not cause the total value of the hand to exceed 21, the ace is called 'usable'. \n",
    "\n",
    "The actions are to *stick*, which means to stop drawing cards and let the dealer play, or to *hit*, which means to draw another card to add to your hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "The opponent is a dealer with a fixed strategy; the dealer will always hit when the dealer's sum of card values is below 17 points. At or above 17 points, the dealer immediately sticks, irrespective of the player's card sum. Note that the dealer only starts playing once the player is finished, so when the player has selected to stick.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game starts by drawing two cards each to player and dealer from an infinite deck. The player can see the own cards, but only the first card which the dealer recieves, the other is face-down. If the player hits and exceeds 21 points, the player is considered *bust* and immediately loses the game. When the player decides to stick, the dealer will draw cards according to its strategy. If the dealer goes *bust* in the process, the player immediately wins the game. If not, the sum of the dealer's card values is compared to the sum of the player's card values. If they are equal, the game is considered a draw. If the player has a higher score, the player wins, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this RL setting, the rewards are +1 for winning, -1 for losing, and 0 for drawing and all intermediate moves. The state is a 3-tuple consisting of the players current hand sum, the value of the dealer's initial open card and a boolean describing whether the player currently has a usable ace or not. The action space consists of the integer $0$, which corresponds to *stick*, and the integer $1$, which corresponds to *hit*. Note that this corresponds exactly to the scenario described in [Example 5.1 in Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Sutton and Barto.](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, please examine the following code cell, which loads the Blackjack environment from the utils file and plays an episode. The player is in this case the random agent. The environment is equivalent to the one provided in OpenAI Gym; we adapted the source code so that installing this python package is not necessary."
